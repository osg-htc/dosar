# High Throughput Computing and Condor Introduction

## Preliminaries

You will need your Gmail or GitHub credentials for this session. 

   * You might want to refer to the [online Condor manual](https://htcondor.org/documentation/htcondor.html).<br>
   * You may enjoy browsing the [Condor web page](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/).<br>

## Which Condor?
We will be using Condor 9.12.0, which is a recent version of Condor.

Condor has two coexisting types of releases at any given time: Feature (development) and Long Term Support (stable). Condor 9.12.0 is considered a stable release, while 9.13.1 is considered a development release. You can know 9.12.0 is stable because the second digit (a 12 in this case) is an even number, while in the development version 9.13.1 it is an odd number (13 in this case). In a given stable series, all versions have the same features (for example 9.10.16 and 9.10.17 have the same set of features) and differ only in bug fixes.

## Where you will work

Today you will log into https://notebook.ospool.osg-htc.org/hub/login for all of your exercises:

Login on submission node using a web browser:

<a href="https://notebook.ospool.osg-htc.org/hub/login" target="_blank">https://notebook.ospool.osg-htc.org/hub/login</a>

Click on 'Sign in with CILogon'.
Select the Identity Provider Google (or GitHub).
Click 'Log On'.
Log into your Google account (or GitHub).
Click the 'Server Option' 'Data Science'.
Click 'Start'. This will take some time.
In the 'Launcher' window, click on 'Terminal' (bottom left).

When you login to the machine you will be in your "home directory".  We recommend that you work in this directory as nobody else can modify the files here.

You can always return to your home directory by running the command

<pre><code>
$ <b>cd ~</b>
</code></pre>

## The Exercises

Throughout the Condor exercises, you will be given a fair amount of guidance. In several spots, there are suggestions for extra exercises to do "on your own" or as "challenges". Since you aren't being graded, there is no extra credit for doing them, but we encourage you to try them out. If you prefer, you can come back to the extra credit after you've completed the basic exercises. If you simply cruise through the exercises, you'll probably have free time--we encourage you to delve in more deeply.

For all of the exercises, we'll assume that you are logged into a terminal in the ospool notebook above. 

## Chris was here. This is a test.
