# Singularity Containers in OSG


### Objective

Singularity is a container system to allow users full control over their enviroment. You
can create your own container image which your job will execute within, or choose from
a set of pre-defined images. For more information about Singularity, please see:

 * [Singularity Home Page](http://singularity.lbl.gov/)

The following talk describes Singularity for scientific computing:

Derek Weitzel wrote a blog post about Singularity on OSG, which provides a good
introduction on how to create images and run them, but does not cover all the
functionality described further down:

## Default Image

The default setup is to auto load an image on sites which support Singularity. Every
job which lands on such a site, will have a container started just for that job, and
then run within that container. Most users will not even know that their jobs are run
within a container, but it will provide them with a consistent environment across
OSG sites. The current default container is based on EL6 and contains a basic
set of tools expected from OSG compute nodes. The image is loaded from
*/cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/osgvo-el6* and the definition file
is available in GitHub
[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osgvo-el6](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osgvo-el6) .
If you want to steer a job to run on a default Singularity instance,
use *HAS_SINGULARITY == True* in the job requirements. For example:

    universe = vanilla
    executable = job.sh
    Requirements = HAS_SINGULARITY == TRUE

    should_transfer_files = IF_NEEDED
    when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT

    output = out
    error = err
    log = log

    queue

To instruct the system to load a different image, use the *+SingularityImage* attribute in 
your job submit file. For example, to run your job under EL7:

    universe = vanilla
    executable = job.sh
    Requirements = HAS_SINGULARITY == TRUE

    +SingularityImage = "/cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/osgvo-el7"
    +SingularityBindCVMFS = True

    should_transfer_files = IF_NEEDED
    when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT

    output = out
    error = err
    log = log

    queue

The user support team maintains a set of images. These contain a basic set of
tools and libraries. The images are are:

|                     | **Image Location**                                                                 | **Defintion** | **Description** |
|:--------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------:|:----------------|
| **EL 6**            | /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/osgvo-el6:latest            | [GitHub](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osgvo-el6)   | A basic Enterprise Linux (CentOS) 6 based image. This is currently our default image |
| **EL 7**            | /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/osgvo-el7:latest            | [GitHub](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osgvo-el7) | A basic Enterprise Linux (CentOS) 7 based image. |
| **Ubuntu Xenial**   | /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/osgvo-ubuntu-xenial:latest  | [GitHub](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osgvo-ubuntu-xenial) | A good image if you prefer Ubuntu over EL flavors |
| **TensorFlow**      | /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/tensorflow:latest           | [GitHub](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osgvo-tensorflow) | Base on the TensorFlow base image, with a few OSG package added |
| **TensorFlow GPU**  | /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/tensorflow-gpu:latest       | [GitHub](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osgvo-tensorflow-gpu) | Used for running TensorFlow jobs on OSG GPU resources |


## Exloring Images on the Submit Host

Images can be explored interactively on the submit hosts by starting it
in "shell" mode. The recommended command line, similar to how containers
are started for jobs, is:

    singularity shell \
                --home $PWD:/srv \
                --pwd /srv \
                --bind /cvmfs \
                --scratch /var/tmp \
                --scratch /tmp \
                --contain --ipc --pid \
                /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/osgvo-ubuntu-xenial:latest


## Custom Images

OSG Connect provides tooling for users to create, publish and load custom images.
This is useful if your job requires some very specific software setup.

### Creating a Custom Image

If you want to use an image you have created yourself, the image
should be defined as a Docker image and published in the [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). The reason we use Docker as a source
image repository is that it allows us to easily import the images into
our own distribution system (see below). To get started, create a Docker
user, sign in to the hub, and create a new repository. You will end up
with an identifier of the *namespace/repository_name* format.

Create an image locally using a *Dockerfile* and the *docker
build*. We suggest you base the image on one of the provided OSG
images. For example, if you want to base the image on our Ubuntu
Xenial image, first download the *Dockerfile* from the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osgvo-ubuntu-xenial).

Edit the *Dockerfile* to fit your requirements. Then build the image with 
tag matching your Docker Hub repository:

    docker build -t namespace/repository_name .

Once you have a successful build, push it to the hub:

    docker push namespace/repository_name

Then register the image as described in the next section.

If you prefer, you can base you image on images not already published by OSG,
but if you do this, we recommend that you as one of the steps create the
*/cvmfs* directory. This will enable the container to access tools and data
published on /cvmfs. In your *Dockerfile*, add:

    # required directories
    RUN mkdir -p /cvmfs

See one of the provided image defintions for a full example.

If you do not want /cvmfs mounted in the container, please add 
*+SingularityBindCVMFS = False* to your job submit file.


### Distributing Custom Images Via CVMFS

In order to be able to efficiently distribute the container images to a large
of distributed compute hosts, OSG has choosen to host the images under
[CVMFS](https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem). Any image publically available in
Docker can be included for automatic syncing into the CVMFS repository. The
result is an unpacked image under */cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/*

To get your images included, please either create a git pull request against
*docker_images.txt* in the
[cvmfs-singularity-sync repository](https://github.com/opensciencegrid/cvmfs-singularity-sync), 
or contact
[user-support@opensciencegrid.org](mailto:user-support@opensciencegrid.org)
and we can help you.

Once your image has been registered, new versions pushed to Docker Hub will
automatically be detected and CVMFS will be updated accordingly.
